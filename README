NAME
    Apache::WinBitHack - An Apache module to emulate XBitHack on Win32

SYNOPSIS
    In Apache's httpd.conf:

       PerlModule Apache::WinBitHack

       <Directory "/Apache/htdocs/some_dir">
          SetHandler perl-script
          PerlFixupHandler Apache::WinBitHack
          XBitHack Full
          Options MultiViews Indexes Includes
       </Directory>

DESCRIPTION
    Apache contains a very useful directive 'XBitHack', whereby a file that
    has the user-execute bit set will be treated as a server-parsed html
    document. As well, the group-execute bit can be used to set the
    Last-modified time of the returned file to be the last modified time of
    the file, which is useful in determining if a document is to be cached
    or not. On Win32 the directive works in principle, but in an
    inconvenient fashion - the execute bit is set on Win32 by the file
    extension, which means that documents that are to take advantage of
    'XBitHack' must have an extension like 'exe' or 'bat'.

    This module emulates 'XBitHack' on Win32 by, rather than using the user
    and group execute bits, using instead the attributes of the file to
    determine if the file is to be server-parsed by mod_include. Attributes
    of a file on Win32, which you can see by running

        C:\> attrib file_name

    include 'archive', 'hidden', 'read-only', and 'system'. Normal user
    files have just the 'archive' attribute set, which some back-up programs
    use to determine if the file should be included in the next incremental
    backup (most backup programs now instead use the last-modified-time of
    the file for this purpose). By setting certain attributes of the file
    and specifying directives as in the SYNOPSIS, particularly the
    'Includes' option, 'XBitHack' can be emulated in the following ways.

  XBitHack Off

    With this directive, no server-side parsing of the file will be
    performed.

  XBitHack On

    This directive emulates setting the user-execute bit. With this
    directive, a file will parsed by mod_include if the 'archive' attribute
    is unset, which you can do by

       C:\> attrib -a file_name

    Note that when a user's file is first created or when it is edited the
    'archive' attribute will normally be set (and all others unset), so you
    must intentionally unset the 'archive' attribute to enable
    server-parsing of the file.

  XBitHack Full

    This directive emulates the action of also setting the group-execute
    bit. With this directive, as with 'XBitHack On', a file will be parsed
    by mod_include if the 'archive' attribute is unset. As well, a
    Last-modified header will be sent, equal to the last-modified time of
    the file, *unless* the 'read-only' attribute of the file is set, which
    you can do by

       C:\> attrib +r file_name
